# Intelligent Telegram Anti-Spam Sex Bots
In today's interconnected world, online communication platforms have become integral parts of our daily lives. However, the anonymity and reach of these platforms also attract malicious actors who exploit them for spamming and spreading harmful content. This Python-based Telegram bot utilizes the power of artificial intelligence to identify and ban intrusive bots that disseminate sexually explicit content in public Telegram groups.

### Introduction
The Intelligent Telegram Anti-Spam Bot safeguards public Telegram groups from the intrusion of bots that spam sexually explicit material. It employs AI to analyze profile pictures and identify patterns indicative of spam behavior. Upon detecting such behavior, the bot swiftly bans the offending bot, protecting the group's integrity and maintaining a safe and enjoyable environment for its members.
